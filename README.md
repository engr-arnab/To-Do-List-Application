To-Do List Application

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a simple yet efficient To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, track, and manage their daily tasks, with options to mark tasks as completed or pending, and delete all tasks at once. The data is stored in localStorage, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.
